Setting up Terraform on Windows and verifying the installation involves the following steps:

1.  **Download Terraform:**

   * Go to the official Terraform website: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
   * Download the Windows 64-bit ZIP archive that matches your system architecture.
1.  **Extract Terraform:**

   * Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to C:\terraform.
1.  **Add Terraform to PATH:**

   * Add the directory where Terraform is extracted to the system PATH so that you can run Terraform commands from any location in the command prompt.
   * Open the Control Panel and go to "System and Security" > "System" > "Advanced system settings."
   * In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   * In the "Environment Variables" window, scroll down to the "System variables" section and select "Path." Click on the "Edit" button.
   * Click on the "New" button and add the path to the directory where Terraform is extracted (e.g., C:\terraform).
   * Click "OK" to save the changes.
1.  **Verify Installation:**

   * Open a new command prompt window to ensure that the changes to the PATH take effect.
   * Run the following command to verify that Terraform is installed and accessible:
```
terraform --version
```
