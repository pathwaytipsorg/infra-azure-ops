Setting up Terraform on Windows and verifying the installation involves the following steps:

1. **Download Terraform:**

   * Go to the official Terraform website: https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
   * Download the Windows 64-bit ZIP archive that matches your system architecture.
1. **Extract Terraform:**

   * Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice. For example, you can extract it to C:\terraform.
1. **Add Terraform to PATH:**

   * Add the directory where Terraform is extracted to the system PATH so that you can run Terraform commands from any location in the command prompt.
   * Open the Control Panel and go to "System and Security" > "System" > "Advanced system settings."
   * In the "System Properties" window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   * In the "Environment Variables" window, scroll down to the "System variables" section and select "Path." Click on the "Edit" button.
   * Click on the "New" button and add the path to the directory where Terraform is extracted (e.g., C:\terraform).
   * Click "OK" to save the changes.
1. **Verify Installation:**

   * Open a new command prompt window to ensure that the changes to the PATH take effect.
   * Run the following command to verify that Terraform is installed and accessible:
```
terraform --version
```
1. **Verify Terraform Configuration:**

   * Create a new directory for your Terraform project, and navigate to that directory in the command prompt.
   * Create a new Terraform configuration file with the .tf extension (e.g., main.tf).
   * Inside the configuration file, add some simple Terraform code, like creating a new resource group:
```
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "my-resource-group"
  location = "Canada Central"
}
```
   * Save the file and run the following command to initialize the Terraform configuration:
```
terraform init
```
   * After initialization, run the following command to see what changes will be applied:
```
terraform plan
```
   * Finally, apply the changes with the following command:
```
terraform apply
```
   * Confirm the changes by typing yes and pressing Enter.
   * Now you can start building and managing your infrastructure with Terraform.
   * If you want to clean up the environment, then destroy the infrastructure by executing the following command.
```
terraform destroy
```
