Terraform code is creating an Azure Resource Group and a Virtual Network within that Resource Group:

1. **Create a resource group**
   ```
   resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my-res-demo" {
      name     = "my-demoresources"
      location = "Central US"
   }
   ```
   Here's what each part of the code does:
   * resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my-demo": This line specifies the resource type (azurerm_resource_group) and assigns a local name (my-demo) to this specific instance of the resource. The local name is used to reference this resource within your configuration.
   * name = "my-demoresources": This sets the name of the Azure Resource Group to "my-demoresources".
   * location = "Central US": This specifies the location (Azure region) where the resource group will be created, in this case, "Central US".
   
1. **Create a virtual network within the resource group**
   ```
   resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "my-demo" {
      name                = "my-demo-network"
      resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.my-res-demo.name
      location            = azurerm_resource_group.my-res-demo.location
      address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
   }
   ```
   This section creates an Azure Virtual Network within the previously created Azure Resource Group. Here's what each attribute does:
   * name = "my-demo-network": This sets the name of the Azure Virtual Network to "my-demo-network".
   * resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.my-demo.name: This specifies the name of the resource group where the virtual network will be created. It references the name attribute of the previously defined azurerm_resource_group resource named my-demo.
   * location = azurerm_resource_group.my-demo.location: This specifies the location (Azure region) of the virtual network. It references the location attribute of the azurerm_resource_group.my-demo resource.
   * address_space = ["10.0.0.0/16"]: This defines the address space for the virtual network in CIDR notation. In this case, it allocates the address range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255, which provides a total of 65,536 IP addresses.


In summary, the provided code creates an Azure Resource Group named "my-demoresources" in the "Central US" region and a Virtual Network named "my-demo-network" within that resource group. The Virtual Network is assigned an address space of 10.0.0.0/16, providing a range of IP addresses for use within the network.
